# Build strong fandom to love and support K-POP

&#x20;The reason why singers, idols, songs, and dances, including K-POP, are loved and created value is of course possible because there are supporters who feel satisfied and happy through it, pay for the cost, interest, and affection. K-POP popularity will also disappear if fans disappear, as well as the case of BTS' fandom "A.R.M.Y."

&#x20;K-POP DAO draws expressions of interest and affection from actual token purchases, and seeks opportunities and satisfaction for further growth and popularity of K-POP and additional profits that return through it. It is mentally and materially strongly connected and pursues a strong token ecosystem and a strong K-POP fandom at the same time through a virtuous cycle structure.
