# K-POP, not just the world, but the bigger world

&#x20;As an axis of the Korean Wave, K-POP has already been recognized worldwide and is expanding its scope. There may be various reasons why K-POP was able to expand its base, but unlike in the past, it has been able to expand its base through various online marketing channels, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc

&#x20;It was important that it spread quickly and widely to young people around the world.

&#x20;In the absence of representative K-POP related coins and tokens, it will become an example of using the latest trends of NFT and DAO to promote K-POP to young people around the world, cheer for it, and participate in it to create K-POP fans and new supports around the world.

&#x20;The expected effect of this will be an effective and fresh example of promoting K-POP in another way, and will serve as a foundation for supporting the K-POP DAO economy, which will be described later.
