The word K-POP (Korean Popular Music), which everyone knows now, and its status is increasing day by day, and it has been recognized as a proper pronoun to the extent that it shakes the music world around the world.&#x20;

In order for the globally recognized flow of K-POP to continue, there must be a sustainable growth model in which new content is provided to fans who enable the popularity of K-POP in line with the rapidly changing trend of the times.

As face-to-face services such as concerts and performances are already difficult due to the pandemic of COVID-19, digital markets such as Metaverse and NFT, which are possible non-face-to-face, are growing, and the domestic entertainment business structure is also increasing its weight.

&#x20;SM and YG, Korea's leading entertainment companies, are also entering the NFT and blockchain markets, and are rapidly expanding their services in the Metaverse market.

&#x20;But what if, unlike the closed and unreasonable structure of large entertainment companies, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) operating system that aims for decentralization could break away from the power-driven structure of the existing entertainment market and make decisions and share them together in a more transparent way?

&#x20;Eight years ago, the K-pop Hallyu Cultural Foundation, which established K-POP corporation and has five subsidiaries, uses K-POP coins, DAO, and NFT to carry out a cultural content industry where the entire nation participates and shares values, not just for a few monopolized interests, entertainment companies, and large stars.
