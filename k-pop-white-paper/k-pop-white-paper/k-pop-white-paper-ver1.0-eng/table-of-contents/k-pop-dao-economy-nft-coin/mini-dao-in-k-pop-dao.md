# mini DAO in K-POP DAO

&#x20;In the upcoming Metaverse, the role of mini DAOs in DAOs is rather emphasized because the concept of existing organizations and national organizations may not be important.

&#x20;Users are a common theme in the big framework of K-POP, but in fact, they are divided into specific fandom that supports specific celebrities and singers.

&#x20;Therefore, in order to effectively organize and foster each small fan club and fandom community, each community is also supported within the community of K-POP DAO.

&#x20;Fan clubs can be organized within the K-POP DAO community for each community of NFT holders.

&#x20;In fact, there can be various fandom by age, so "people who like stars like me" can share and enjoy the NFT project of their favorite celebrities together, and further create a space for communication with them.

&#x20;Of course, since NFT is used, it is possible to form a sense of homogeneity through picture for profile (PFP) and support the singer or NFT creator.
