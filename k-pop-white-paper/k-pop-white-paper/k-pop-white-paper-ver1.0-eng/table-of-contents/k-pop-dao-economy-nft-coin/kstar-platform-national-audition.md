&#x20;The Hallyu Culture Foundation is planning to expand the base of K-POP COIN and make practical use of it.

&#x20;The event will be held in May 2022 and will be held through the 'K Platform' application

&#x20;Anyone of all ages can participate. The winner will be given K-POP coins as prize money, and the Korea Cultural Foundation will support the winner to become a bigger star.

&#x20;Starting with this, it plans to continue to revitalize K-POP COIN and expand K-POP DAO community power through various planning and utilization sources, including "K-Support" to support start-ups and corporate advertising, and "K-funding" to fund content with high public interest and high potential value.
