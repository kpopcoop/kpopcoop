# DAO Use Cases

&#x20;DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization.

&#x20;It is an organization that makes decisions and operates through rules enforced through smart contracts on the blockchain.

&#x20;The most important feature and advantage of DAO is transparency.

&#x20; It is more transparent than a company with a traditional structure because anyone can easily view the entire activity history of the DAO.

&#x20; LinksDAO sells a collection of NFTs for golf course purchases, and the owner provides various perks such as the right to become a member to purchase golf course memberships, discounts on usage fees, and membership-only community participation rights and distributes profits.

&#x20; Metafactory designs fashion culture-related products by designers, selects them by vote, produces and sells products, and shares profits from sales. As a result, designers design more diligently, and voters vote for good design and personal promotion.

&#x20;As a result, the virtuous cycle of this structure increases sales volume and shares more revenue

&#x20; In addition, various products, real assets, and projects are operated in the form of DAO's organization.
